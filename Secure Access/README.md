# Secure Access to Kubernetes

Repository for liveProject: **Securing Access to Kubernetes**

## Objective

The objective of *Securing Access to Kubernetes* is to:

- Use **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control)
- Assign users and service accounts the appropriate roles and permissions
- Avoid granting excessive permissions to any user or service account, as this could lead to access to all resources in a cluster
